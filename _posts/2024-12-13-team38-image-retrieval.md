# Content-Based Image Retrieval: A Deep Dive

**Authors: Aral, Azad, Vikram**

---

## Introduction
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) leverages mathematical representations of image content to identify visually similar images within large datasets. The process involves mapping an image, represented as a matrix of pixel intensities, into a high-dimensional feature vector space. Let $$ \Phi $$ represent the feature extraction function, mapping an input image $$ I \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times W \times H} $$ (channels, width, height) to a feature vector $$ \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^D $$:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \Phi(I), \quad \text{where } \Phi : \mathbb{R}^{C \times W \times H} \to \mathbb{R}^D.
$$

Then, we input an image to the system with the goal of retrieving similar images. To do so, the system computes a similarity score between the query image's feature vector and those in the database using distance metrics, such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or a variety of others not displayed here:

$$
d(\mathbf{v}_q, \mathbf{v}_i) = \| \mathbf{v}_q - \mathbf{v}_i \|_2, \quad \text{or } \frac{\mathbf{v}_q \cdot \mathbf{v}_i}{\| \mathbf{v}_q \| \| \mathbf{v}_i \|}.
$$

The top-\(k\) images with the highest similarity scores are returned as results, offering both visual and semantic relevance.

## Approaches and Techniques to Image Retrieval
CBIR systems utilize various strategies to identify similar images, but follow the same pattern of extracting a meaningful representation of an image into a high-dimensional vector, and then comparing this vector to other feature vectors of images:

## 1. Basic Feature Extraction with CNNs
### Process
The database of feature vectors is formed by sending training images through a  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which extracts deep features like edges, textures, shapes, and spatial patterns. However, we skip the last (fully connected) layer to obtain a high-dimensional vector containing rich information about the image. There are many methods of storing these feature vectors in a memory-efficient way, as storing tensors with thousands of elements can occupy excessive amounts of memory, often more than available. Some such methods include vector quantization or Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which both attempt to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors while still maintaining the rich meaning encoded within.

When given a query image, we run it through the same CNN and obtain a feature vector describing the query image. Using one of several distance metrics, often cosine similarity or Euclidean distance, we find the top-<em>k</em> similar vectors, and return the associated images.
### Feature Vectors
High-dimensional vectors (e.g., 512 or 1024 dimensions) are generated from intermediate CNN layers to represent an image, and an example feature vector from ResNet-18 is shown below:
```python
[0.45, -0.12, 0.34, ..., 0.89]  # Image 1 (dog)
[0.47, -0.10, 0.31, ..., 0.87]  # Image 2 (dog)
```

## 2: LoFTR: Detector-Free Local Feature Matching with Transformers

---

### Motivation  
LoFTR introduces a new approach to **image feature detection** to address challenges faced by traditional methods, such as:  
- Poor repeatability in **low-texture areas**.  
- Errors in **repetitive patterns**.  
- Variations in **viewpoint and lighting**.  

LoFTR utilizes a **detector-free dense matching pipeline with Transformers**, diverging from traditional local feature-matching methods that rely on sequential steps: **feature detection, description, and matching**.  
Instead, LoFTR:  
1. Produces **dense matches** in regions where traditional feature detectors struggle.  
2. Refines these matches at the coarse dense level to resolve ambiguities.

---

### Techniques  
The researchers trained two specific models for different environments:  
- **Indoor Model**: Trained on the **ScanNet** dataset.  
- **Outdoor Model**: Trained on the **MegaDepth** public dataset.

---

### Architecture  
The LoFTR architecture comprises **four key components** to achieve robust local feature matching:  

1. **Feature Extraction Backbone**:  
   - Uses a standard **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to extract **multi-level features** from input images.  
   - Generates **coarse-level** and **fine-level features**.  
   - **Downsampling** in CNN reduces input length, lowering computational costs.  

2. **Coarse-Level Feature Transformation**:  
   - Reshapes features into **1D vectors** and adds **positional encodings**.  
   - Processes features through a **Transformer module**, combining:  
     - **Self-Attention Layers**: For capturing global context.  
     - **Cross-Attention Layers**: For position-aware descriptors.  

3. **Matching Module**:  
   - Uses a **differentiable matching layer** to compute a **confidence matrix**, identifying likely correspondences between the feature maps of two images.  
   - Matches are selected based on:  
     - **Mutual-Nearest-Neighbor Criteria**.  
     - A **confidence threshold**.  
   - This forms the initial set of **coarse-level matches**.  

4. **Fine-Level Refinement Module**:  
   - Crops a small window around each coarse match.  
   - Refines these matches to produce **final matches with sub-pixel accuracy**.

    <p style='text-align: center'><em>Figure x: Framework [1]</em></p>
</div>

### Results  
LoFTR was evaluated in both **indoor** and **outdoor** environments, outperforming existing methods:  

- Compared to **SuperGlue** and **DRC-Net**, LoFTR produced:  
  - **More correct matches**.  
  - **Fewer mismatches**.  
- Delivered **high-quality matches** in challenging areas, such as:  
  - Texture-less walls.  
  - Floors with repetitive patterns.  
- Achieved **first-place rankings** on two public benchmarks for visual localization.  

LoFTRâ€™s results demonstrate its effectiveness in **real-world applications** and its reliability in addressing areas where traditional methods struggle.

## 3: Learning Super-Features for Image Retrieval

---

### Motivation  
Traditional feature detection and matching methods, such as using **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** features, have significant limitations. Methods like the **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** detect keypoints individually and compute descriptors around these separate, independent keypoints. This approach **ignores the spatial relationships** between keypoints, making the method:  
- Sensitive to **viewpoint changes**.  
- Sensitive to **lighting variations**.  

Even modern deep learning methods, such as **CNN-based approaches**, fail to consider spatial relationships. However, clusters of keypoints often contain **rich contextual information**. For example, a cluster of keypoints around a **building edge** has a predictable structure that can be recognized.

---

### Techniques  
To address these challenges and capture **Super-Features**, the paper introduces an **iterative Local Feature Integration Transformer**:  
- This method adapts **pre-existing attention modules** for image retrieval tasks.  
- During training, the loss is directly applied to **Super-Features**, and no additional labels or annotations are required beyond the image data itself.

### Architecture  
The proposed framework follows a multi-step process to generate **Super-Features**:  

1. **Feature Extraction Backbone**:  
   - A backbone **CNN** extracts dense **feature maps** that encode **local patterns** and textures from the input image.

2. **Super-Feature Extraction**:  
   - The framework detects **salient regions** from the feature maps. These regions capture **spatial and geometric context** that is meaningful for retrieval.  

3. **Context-Aware Processing**:  
   - The framework uses **non-local attention mechanisms** to incorporate spatial relationships across the image.  
   - These attention modules allow the model to focus on **non-adjacent regions** in the image, ensuring that features capture long-range dependencies.

4. **Training Objective**:  
   The network minimizes losses for both:  
   - **Keypoint Detection**: Ensures that detected keypoints are repeatable across transformed images.  
     - **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss.  
   - **Descriptor Matching**: Ensures that corresponding keypoints in two images have similar descriptors.  
     - **Loss Function**: Triplet Loss.  

---

### How It Works  
1. **Input**: A reference image from the dataset and a query image are fed into the network.  
2. **Feature Map Generation**: Dense feature maps are extracted using the backbone CNN.  
3. **Keypoint and Descriptor Extraction**:  
   - The framework detects keypoints and computes context-aware descriptors from the feature maps.  
4. **Matching**: These context-rich features enable better comparison between images, resulting in more accurate **image retrieval**.

---

### Results  
The paper evaluates the proposed method, **FIRe** (Feature Integration-based Retrieval), against state-of-the-art techniques. The network is trained on the **SfM-120k** dataset. Key results include:  

- **Memory Efficiency**:  
   - Other methods required a minimum of **7.9 GB** for the full R1M image set.  
   - The FIRe method used only **6.4 GB**.  

- **Accuracy Improvements**:  
   - On the **R-Oxford + R-1M hard sets**, FIRe achieved an improvement of **3.3 points**.  
   - On the **R-Paris + R-1M hard sets**, the improvement was as high as **12.2 points**.
        - **R-Oxford** and **R-Paris** are datasets containing buildings from Oxford, England and Paris, France, respectively.
        - **R-1M** is a distractor dataset that aims to emulate real image retrieval tasks by adding irrelevant images that do not belong to the same categories as the other datasets  

These results demonstrate that FIRe outperforms existing methods both in terms of **accuracy** and **memory efficiency**.
